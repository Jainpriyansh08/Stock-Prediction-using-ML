Conclusion
A. Finding

In this paper, we have proposed a stock recommendation system using Random Forest and J48 Algorithm. Instead of using raw data, sampled data is used to predict future trend, but sampled data cause the effect of data overfitting which is further reduced by pruning tree, Random Forest and Bagging technique. It is observed that in real time scenario this model yield good result with less risk. he stocks return of listed companies is an issue that every stakeholder concern about very much. Managers of companies try every means to improve the company's financial performance and hope to maintain good trends in the future. Investors also pay close attention to companies' stock return and make investment decision basing on this. To forecast and improve companies' financial performance, we must understand what factors affect the financial outcomes. The importance of the financial statement analysis (also known as fundamental analysis) is well known, in this paper we extract 50 financial indicators from the three statements according to the present information disclosure condition of Chinese listed companies, builds the Chinese listed companies stock return forecasting model by applying the decision tree algorithm improved by Bagging technology, for predicting the change of earnings per share of listed companies. The empirical results show that, compared with the existing research, the decision tree algorithm improved by Bagging has a good predicting result. Taking Bagging method to improve the decision tree can not only increase the classification accuracy, but also can reduce the computing time. We believe as the study of decision tree algorithm gradually grows perfect; it must gain better effects when applied in predicting stock returns. At the meanwhile, since Chinese information disclosure is not perfect, we can only access to the data later than 2000 year, the number of financial indicators is not quite sufficient. As Chinese information disclosure mechanism and capital market become more and more developed, there will be more data can be taken to conduct research, which is quite helpful to improve the accuracy of forecasting model.

Since Chinese current economy is during a rapid developing period, the capital market is bound to have certain characteristics and particularity, and there are some inevitable limitations in our study. Thus, our conclusions could only illustrate problems within the limited circumstances and under certain conditions. In this paper, the main limitations are: 1) the forecasting accuracy of the financial performance in this paper is not very high, there is still much room for it to improve. 2) We have adopted binary dependent variable in designing dependent variable in the forecasting model, which would make the information lost to some extent. 3) The sample size is still insufficient (in particular, time span is too short). As time is passing and information disclosure mechanism in China is being gradually perfected, there will be more data (including information of non-listed companies) could be used to do research and this is beneficial to improve the accuracy of prediction.

Based on research and analysis between decision tree, SVM and Neural Networks, Decision Tree gave out the best results as compared to the others because of its:

Interpretability.

If we want to be able to understand and explain our result, then a decision tree is a lot cleaner.

Speed

Building a decision tree is often a lot quicker and computationally less intensive than building a neural network. That said efficient Bagging algorithms are often faster than a single huge tree if you have multiple cores and will perform better.

Skill

Tuning and engineering a neural network requires a lot of skill (well, some of the time).

 

B. Further Research

Future researchers may include more methods for finding the best model for predicting stock prices. Twitter sentiment analysis technique can be used to perform voting system along with this model, which can avoid the complete dependence on historical stock data. News based system can also be integrated to get the fresh news along with previous historical results of the specific firm to avoid losses in market. Instead of always booking profit on 10% rise and selling on 3% fall, a new Trading model can be built based on probability distribution of the decision based on the model output.
