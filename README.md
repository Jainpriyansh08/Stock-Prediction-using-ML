#CONCLUSION

#A. Finding

   In this paper, we have proposed a stock recommendation system using Random Forest and J48 Algorithm. Instead of using raw data, sampled data is used to predict future trends, but sampled data cause the effect of    
   data overfitting which is further reduced by pruning trees, Random Forest and Bagging techniques. It is observed that in real-time scenarios this model yields good result with less risk. he stocks return of listed 
   companies is an issue that every stakeholder concern about very much. Managers of companies try every means to improve the company's financial performance and hope to maintain good trends in the future. Investors 
   also pay close attention to companies' stock return and make investment decision basing on this. To forecast and improve companies' financial performance, we must understand what factors affect the financial 
   outcomes. The importance of the financial statement analysis (also known as fundamental analysis) is well known, in this paper we extract 50 financial indicators from the three statements according to the present 
   information disclosure condition of Chinese listed companies, builds the Chinese listed companies stock return forecasting model by applying the decision tree algorithm improved by Bagging technology, for 
   predicting the change of earnings per share of listed companies. The empirical results show that, compared with the existing research, the decision tree algorithm improved by Bagging has a good predicting result. 
   Taking Bagging method to improve the decision tree can not only increase the classification accuracy, but also can reduce the computing time. We believe as the study of decision tree algorithms gradually grows 
   perfect; it must gain better effects when applied in predicting stock returns. At the meanwhile, since Chinese information disclosure is not perfect, we can only access to the data later than 2000 year, the number 
   of financial indicators is not quite sufficient. As Chinese information disclosure mechanism and capital market become more and more developed, there will be more data can be taken to conduct research, which is 
   quite helpful to improve the accuracy of forecasting model.


   Based on research and analysis between decision tree, SVM and Neural Networks, the Decision Tree gave out the best results as compared to the others because of its:

INTERPRETABILITY:

  If we want to be able to understand and explain our result, then a decision tree is a lot cleaner.

SPEED:

  Building a decision tree is often a lot quicker and computationally less intensive than building a neural network. That said efficient Bagging algorithms are often faster than a single huge tree if you have multiple 
  cores and will perform better.

SKILL:

  Tuning and engineering a neural network requires a lot of skill (well, some of the time).

 

#B. FURTHER RESEARCH

   Future researchers may include more methods for finding the best model for predicting stock prices. Twitter sentiment analysis technique can be used to perform a voting system along with this model, which can avoid 
   the complete dependence on historical stock data. A news-based system can also be integrated to get fresh news along with the specific firm's previous historical results to avoid market losses. Instead of 
   always booking profit on a 10% rise and selling on a 3% fall, a new Trading model can be built based on probability distribution of the decision based on the model output.
